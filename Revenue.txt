lets talk.

to get our website popular, we will have to advertise in the places we live. First let's gather the population of each city/town/village (xD) we live in.

Mine has a population of around 100,000 people
my school has 500 people, BUT i am moving schools next year bc of middle school. The school i am going to has over 1000 people

I used to live in a city with 1.583 Million people, i have a TON of friends there i can spread the news to. they can spread it there too. I also have friends/reletives that live in another country


Mine has 1.028 million. BUT, i cant spread the word to all of them xD My school has abt 600 kids and my class about 30.

Here is how it works if you didnt know (i knew)
u tell one person, they tell their friends, their friends telll their friends, they tell their friends, and so on

i knew, but how do you know the'll share the word?
tell them to xD. theres like a 6% chance teyll doit n their own

lets see pros and cons of ads on our website.

cons
- they are annoying
- its not like we can make 1.6 MILLION (we could, if we get super high of google search)
- people will get adblockers, that pretty much finishes it up 

pros
- we make money
- prompts people to buy pro (bc they will get tired of ads)
- we can block adblockers (not really a pro of ads.. xD)

now, lets think probabilities here xD we need to think of the amount of people we can tell, based on that we see how much site views we get, then we use the ad calc to see how much money we get <-- That basically, right?

how many people can we influence?

i have about 30-50 families in my neighborhood <-- idk about that..
20 people in my class
50+ reletives that arent in Canada
more than 20 friends in Calgary (the city with more than 1.5M population)
around 15 friends (not in my class) plus their families are around 80 people 

we cant really count famlys here bc google will track ip adresses bc google is smart and they wont like it if we just keep spam reloading to make money or even if they think dat

yeah but most of my friends have different devices xD
WAIT FLYERS ARENT A BAD IDEA, bc i saw a flyer for a company that provides tv service.

bt google can track --> network <-- ip adresses

google does not care about ip, they still show ads xD

ik but they dont give us revenue, google is SMART
they do lol, google takes 40% and gives the rest to us

i have idk mabye 30-40 in neibhorhood and 30 in class?

so there is this whatsapp group where i live that is used to advertise small businesses, my mom has a dance class thing so she is in the group. There are around 50 people in it (i think)

I HAVE A REALLY BIG EXTENED FAMILY, AND WE HAVE A WHATSAPP GROUP, I COULD SHARE. i could also share in my class and school, im going to 5th SOON.  <-- Same except not the 5th, im going to 7th xD

i have friends too. and im sure my mom has more ways of sharing the word.

in total i could maybe inform 280+ people? (with flyers, whatsapp, mouth, friends, dad's colleagues)

maybe around 60% (135 people) will keep on using the app, and out of that 135, mAyBe 20% will buy pro (27 people)


i could make prob mabye 75 people at MAX (mabye around 10 would keep using and 0 will buy pro.)  (i prob wont be ale to do even 30) :/ (:cri:)

why don't u do flyers, not a bad idea.


My aim is 100,000 pageviews per month, that way we get abt 17 bucks per year FOR THE FIRST YEAR. WE WILL MAKE A HIGHER GOAL WHEN WE REACH OUR CURRENT.

doog idea


lets think of all the ways we can spread the word and how many people we can spread the word to.

- mouth - bad idea, mabye 10-20
- flyers - abt 20 people
- Whatsapp - mabye 50-60 people
- social media - A LOT, like 70-80
- school - best idea, mabye 60-70 people bc everyone goes to school
- friends - mabye 10-20 people
- family - mabye 10-20 peeps
- news - where i live, its really easy to get in the newspaper. Plus i have a friend that's been in the news before, so i can ask them for help :P - abt 100 people

15+20+55+75+65+10+10+100 = 350 people. 350 people, they tell will tell friends, 400 will keep using. then mabye we get 60,000 page views per month, then 10,000 bucks per year.
